      <h1>How third parties can swing elections</h1>

            <p>The viability and impact of third-party candidates on American political races has been hotly debated for years, particularly in close contests between Democrats and Republicans.</p>

            <p>In Minnesota, independent politicians used to be stronger, reaching the height of their influence when Jesse Ventura took the 1996 gubernatorial race by surprise, grabbing enough votes from the unaffiliated center and from both major parties to win.</p>

            <p>But the influence of third party candidates isn't always so obvious, and sometimes requires hindsight gleaned further into the future.</p>
            
            <p>A good example is 2016's bruising loss by then-DFL candidate Angie Craig to Republican Jason Lewis for Minnesota’s Second Congressional District. At the time, Green Party challenger Paula Overby was had a relatively strong showing in the area, and Democrats criticized her for pulling votes away and getting Lewis elected. </p>
            
            <p>The dynamics of this three-way contest gained further clarity after 2018's rematch between Craig and Lewis, one where Overby was absent from the race’s ballot.</p>

            <p>A Star Tribune analysis shows precincts in 2018 reported Democratic percentages either <span class="legendary green2">over</span> or <span class="legendary purple1">even</span> (within two points) the combined 2016 totals of Craig and Overby, while only some totals were <span class="legendary orange2">less</span> than the previous cycle, mostly in areas trending Republican.</p>

              <p>District Two's results shows Craig's 2018 totals closely matched her combined 2016 totals with Overby in two-thirds of precincts.</p>

              <p>While turnout was different between the presidential year contests and the midterm, comparing vote percentages reveals a stark trend of Craig gaining in proportions very similar – and in some cases virtually identical – to Overby's previous performance.</p>

    <section class="container-lg leadin">
        <p>About a third of the time, Craig's 2018 vote percentage surpassed the combined non-Republican vote in 2016, signaling areas in the district became more Democratic between elections. Craig fared worse than the combined 2016 outcomes in only a few precincts where Lewis performed better than previously.</p>

        <p>Whether or not Democrats, Republicans, challengers or incumbents are affected by the presence of dark horse checkboxes on the ballot isn’t always clear, but these alternate choices have taken the blame for several high-profile electoral upsets over the years. Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader, for instance, gets heavily blamed by Democrats for Al Gore losing to George Bush in 2000. Similarly, libertarian Ross Perot is charged with drawing away enough Republican votes to get Bill Clinton elected to the Oval Office in 1992.</p>
            
        <p>As 2020’s election cycle revs up to full speed, multiple independent challengers are slated to run for seats spanning the local elections to federal races. Which voters they attract depends upon their policies and perceived ideological leanings, with leftwing, progressive or socialist candidates often affecting Democratic turnout while rightwing, libertarian and conservative independents usually targeting Republicans.</p>
        
        <p>Whether this coming election showcases similarly contentious multi-directional races remains to be seen.</p>
